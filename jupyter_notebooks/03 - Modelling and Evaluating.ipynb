    "## Objectives\n",
    "To develop, train, and evaluate a machine learning model for image classification, incorporating image augmentation and comprehensive performance analysis through various metrics and visualizations. The objective includes modifying class indices, plotting augmented images, creating and summarizing the model, and saving the trained model. Model performance will be assessed using accuracy, ROC curves, and classification reports, followed by plotting the confusion matrix and saving the evaluation results. The final output will also involve making predictions on a random image file."
